## What is Aura-Note?

Aura-Note is a simple note taking sample application that demonstrates many of the features and patterns used when building an Aura based application.  The [Aura 101 tutorial](https://github.com/forcedotcom/aura-note/blob/master/Aura101.pdf) walks you through building a component and putting it in the app.

To find out more about Aura please see the [Aura Documentation](http://documentation.auraframework.org/auradocs) site or see the instructions at the end of this README for 
accessing the documentation on your localhost after you build the project.
